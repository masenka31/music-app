# AI.MUSIC

This is a repository containing most of the code responsible for running the music recommendation project AI.MUSIC at http://aimusic-app.herokuapp.com/

## Project

This project was created using Python and Django framework and making use of HTML template. 
The project uses Spotify datasets (playlists) and state-of-the art machine learning models. 
Implemented models are
* Word2Vec
* ALS model
* random model
* KNN model

## Our Team

- Tomáš Brisučiak — Python guru and model developer
- Martin Kovanda — neural networks architect
- Michal Malík — dataset master and all-purpose helper
- Michaela Mašková — self-taught full-stack developer

Models were developed and tested by Tomáš and Martin. Michal is responsible for preparing datasets. He also cooperated
with Martin on the suprise factor. The app itself was developed by me, Michaela.

## Note for the curious
I'm fully aware of multiple problems with the repository, code, and design choices. The aim of this app is not to be perfectly optimised, but rather serve the purpose and be functional. The app was developed by a complete beginner to Django, and beginner in Python (and object oriented programming). If your eyes bleed when reading the code, I am truly sorry.
